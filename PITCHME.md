### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Why?</span></p>

Note:
- Single window for full platform configuration 
- Avoid multiple hotkeys
- Localization support
- Unified look and feel
- If driver supports any configuration, must be implemented using HII
- Expose content to be seamlessly integrated in platform solutions

@title[Design Discussions]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Design Discussions</span></p>
 
Note:
- The example on the right shows a basic platform configuration or “setup” model. 
- The drivers and applications install elements (such as fonts, strings, images and forms) into the HII Database, which acts as a central repository for the entire platform. The Forms Browser uses these elements to render the user interface on the display devices and receive information from the user via HID devices. When complete, the changes made by the user in the Forms Browser are saved, either to the EFI global variable storage—(GetVariable() and  SetVariable()— or to variable storage provided by the individual drivers

- TOP
  - Platform and Standard User Interactions

- Bottom
  - There are various scenarios where a platform component must interact in some fashion with the user. Examples of this are when presenting a user with several choices of information (e.g. boot menu) and sending information to the display (e.g. system status, logo, etc).

@title[HII Strings]
### <p align="right">Strings</p>

Note:
- Strings stored in Unicode
  - Real string encodings required for e.g. VT100
  - Already the text standard in EFI today
- Localization happens at the string level
  - Caller externs and passes in language independent string token
  - String support determines actual string from token and selected language
  - Usage Model:
    - A string library supporting translations
    - Reduces translation costs and delays
    - Tools to extract strings depending on use by driver
    - Analysis of strings used to extract fonts

---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide19.JPG
@title[Token to String Mapping]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Token to String Mapping</span></p>

Note:
- Request: Print string with token 37
- Currently selected language is as in UEFI 2.X.  This is used to select between language data structures.  (The structures indicate which language(s) they support).
- The top part of the structure maps from token to string. The bottom part of the structure is the strings

@title[HII Fonts]
### <p align="right">Fonts</p>

Note:
- One Standard Font for UEFI
  - One font database accumulated during boot
- Each Component Provides Its Fonts
  - System provides ASCII and ISO Latin-1
  - Fonts only required for characters in strings that may appear
    - If the firmware will never print “tractor” in Kanji, discard the bit image
  - Result is a sparse array of characters indexed by the Unicode ‘weight’
- Wide and Narrow glyphs supported 




---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide22.JPG
@title[HII Keyboards]
### <p align="right">Keyboards</p>

Note:

- Support varying keyboards
  - UK and US keyboard layout are not the same.  Certainly that is the case for US and Arabic, etc.
  - Adding support of other modifiers (e.g. Alt-GR, Dead-keys, etc)
- Keyboard Layout
  - Allow for a standardized mechanism to describe a keyboard layout and add to system database.
  - Allow for switching keyboard layouts.  



---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide23.JPG
@title[HII Forms]
### <p align="right">Forms</p>

Note:
- How a UEFI driver or application may present a forms (or dialogs) based interface. The forms-based interface assumes that each window or screen consists of some window dressing (title & buttons) and a list of questions. These questions represent individual configuration settings for the application or driver, although several GUI controls may be used for one question 

- The forms are stored in the HII database, along with the strings, fonts & images
- Other applications may use the information within the forms to validate configuration setting values
- The Forms Browser provides a forms-based user interface which understands 
  - how to read the contents of the forms
  - interact with the user
  - save the resulting values
- The Forms Browser uses forms data installed by an application or driver during initialization in the HII database. 


---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide24.JPG
@title[Visual Forms Representation (VFR)]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Visual Forms Representation (VFR)</span></p>

Note:
- VFR (Visual Forms Representation) is the development language used to create IFR (Internal Forms Representation). IFR is the compiled version of the control language. This language controls what the contents of each displayed page consists of, where the changed data gets saved, how pages are linked, and much more. 
- VFR source files will include a Unicode file(s) which contains the string definitions for the particular application. The Unicode file will contain both the displayed strings as well as the translations for all the supported languages for the particular application. 

- Language used to describe what a page layout would be in a browser as well as the op-codes and string tokens to display 
- Op-codes are defined for the following functions examples
  - formSet and form definitions
  - One of type questions with corresponding options (combo) fields
```
    checkbox 
    numeric 
    oneof 
    String
```	
  - Boolean expressions in support of errors, suppress, and gray outs
```
  "disableif" 
  “suppressif“
  “grayoutif"  
```

  option text = STRING_TOKEN(STR_ONE_OF_TEXT3), value = 0x2, flags = DEFAULT;

endformset;
</pre>


---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide26.JPG
@title[Internal Forms Representation (IFR)]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Internal Forms Representation (IFR)</span></p>

Note:
- Internal Forms Representation created by VFR to IFR tool
- Byte encoded operations (much smaller)
- String references abstracted as tokens
- Improved validation, visibility primitives
- At better level of presentation control for firmware
  - Tension between configuration driver and presentation driver over control of presentation format
- Easy to
  - Interpret for small Setup engine in desktop firmware
  - Translate into XHTML or JavaScript or …

Note:
- The EFI Configuration Driver is the program that reads the contents of the HII Database and interprets the data to present it to the user. This is also the program that takes the user input and provides for a mechanism to save the changes into an NVRAM location. 
- There is an assumption of having some type of NVRAM available so that settings that are changed by the user are able to be saved. How one gets to the NVRAM is based on whether it is system NV storage one is accessing, or NV storage local to a specific card. Both are supported. 
- With the exception of setting a system password, and system date and time, settings are not posted to NV storage until the user directs the infrastructure specifically to do so. As a rule of thumb, hardware configuration changes do not take place until a system reset has occurred.
